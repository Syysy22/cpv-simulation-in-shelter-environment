# CPV Simulation in a Shelter Environment

This repository accompanies my MSc Data Science dissertation.  
It contains the code and input data used to simulate canine parvovirus (CPV) transmission within a rehoming centre.

## Repository Contents

- **`data/paths.*`** — shapefile of the rehoming centre.  
- **`movement_simulation.py`** — generates movement data and saves it as `full_simulation.pkl`.
- **`full_simulation.pkl`** — not stored on GitHub due to size limits; it will be created automatically when you run `movement_simulation.py`.  
- **`infection_baseline.py`** — uses the saved movement data to simulate infection spread in base scenarios.
